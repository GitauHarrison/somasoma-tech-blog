            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                Flask was originally designed and developed by Armin Ronacher as an 
                April Fool's Day joke in 2010. Despite the origin as a joke, 
                the Flask framework became wildly popular as an alternative to 
                Django projects with their monolithic structure and dependencies.
            </p>
            <p>
                Flask's success created a lot of additional work in issue tickets and pull requests. 
                Armin eventually created The Pallets Projects collection of open source code 
                libraries after he had been managing Flask under his own GitHub account for 
                several years. The Pallets Project now serves as the community-driven organization 
                that handles Flask and other related Python libraries such as Lektor, 
                Jinja and several others.
            </p>
            <p>
                Flask is considered more Pythonic than the Django web framework because in 
                common situations the equivalent Flask web application is more explicit. 
                Flask is also easy to get started with as a beginner because there is little 
                boilerplate code for getting a simple app up and running.

                (clearly years of experience distilled). I'm a frustrated Django developer and 
                was just getting started with Flask, trying to figure out how best to structure 
                my app, absorb best practices, etc.. Funny thing is, every part of the stack 
                you've chosen is exactly what I'd want to use."

                "You have a great delivery style and each video feels like he's with you stepping 
                you through the code. Whenever a problem has occurred, even if it's not directly 
                related to the code/course content, he has been gone above and beyond in getting 
                it resolved. I've never known any other course author to do that. 
                If you want to learn Flask or just about building a SAAS app, look no further."
